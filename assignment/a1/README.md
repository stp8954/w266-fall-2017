# Assignment 1: Information Theory and TensorFlow

## Due: September 14, 2017 11:59 PM Pacific

This assignment consists of two unrelated parts:

* [Infomation Theory Review](information_theory.ipynb)
* [TensorFlow Introduction](tensorflow/fun_with_tensorflow.ipynb)

While we're releasing them at the same time, we strongly recommend that you do that [Assignment 0](../a0/) first to verify that you're all set up with IPython and TensorFlow.

**Hint:** James will be going through Assignment 1 in the extra office hour in Week 2 (September 6 2017 at 7pm). Please come with your questions!

The information theory notebook is designed to be self-contained and not depend on the async or readings. The async, however, will reference a number of concepts from this notebook - so we hope that it serves as useful background!

We anticipate you will spend most of your time on the TensorFlow introduction.
TensorFlow is a somewhat different programming model than you may be used to. 
Similar to MapReduce, it breaks constructing the computational graph and executing it into two separate steps. 
Some students describe this introduction as the hardest 10 lines of code they've had to write - but we promise that it gets a *lot* easier from there!

## Submission instructions 

As with Assignment 0, please submit by running the submit script:
